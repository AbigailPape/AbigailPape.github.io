		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>MathHelp 24/7 was created by a high school student who often wanted help with her math homework, but was unable to find it in an understandable, and more importantly, free format. She decided to create a free online resource that would be accessible to any student with an Internet connection. She wanted the information to be applicable to a wide variety of math topics and classes so any math student would be able to find help. Presenting it in a simple and easy-to-understand format allowed her to ensure that it could be easily referenced and understood without the hassle of complex site navigation or ads. Now, free and understandable math help for students is available at any time on MathHelp 24/7!</p>
